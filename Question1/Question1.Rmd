# Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great distress and turmoil around the world. Many lives have been affected and taken by this disease and it continues to negatively impact our way of living as we know it. The great global impact of this pandemic highlights the need of a informed public as well as informed policy makers. This short report therefore aims at providing an overview of the consequences Covid 19 had. 

Starting off, we are going to look at some general statistics. 

```{r, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Total Covid cases.\\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
#shows the general distribution of cases over time by continent 
#problem: missing values for continent --> omitt missing values?
g <- plot_cases_continent1(covid_owid, xaxis_rows = 2, xaxis_size = 5)
g
```



```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Total Covid Cases.\\label{Figure2}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
#shows the general distribution of cases over time by continent (now via ISO code)
g <- plot_cases_iso(covid_owid, xaxis_rows = 2, xaxis_size = 5)
g
```

```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Total Covid Cases.\\label{Figure3}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
#COVID cases per region, can see that Africa 
h <- plot_cases_separate(covid_owid, xaxis_rows = 2, xaxis_size = 5)
h
#try and do the same thing for the deaths later on and add interpretation 
#if time, group by upper middle income countries as well etc. 
```

```{r}
gg <- plot_cases_elderly(covid_owid)
gg
```

#More detailed insights
Select 6 different countries (Germany,USA, Ghana, South Africa, Chile, Australia) and compare them: make a case study. Start with 
- comparing cases based on elderly population (look at regions that have highest and lowest count)
- compared it based on poverty 
- based on smokers (maybe case study)
- effect of vaccines
